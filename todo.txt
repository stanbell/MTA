    if user wants last or first, put names in that way when entering clients 
_ reconcile intake form has first/last name, where i have only 1

_ DEBUG calendar color wrong on selected day after add new appt if no appt previously
_ DEBUG color wrong on current date if has appts (cause starts as selected day?)
